# Substorm: Advanced Domain Fuzzing & Subdomain Generation Tool 🚀

**Substorm** is a powerful and efficient tool designed to generate massive permutations of subdomains based on user-defined patterns. Whether you're conducting penetration testing, recon exercises, or looking to expand your DNS mapping, Substorm streamlines the process by creating exhaustive subdomain lists tailored to your needs.

## Key Features 🌟

- **Pattern-Based Subdomain Generation:**  
  Generate subdomains using customizable patterns, such as `{{sub}}.{{word}}.{{domain}}` or `{{region}}-{{sub}}-{{word}}.{{domain}}`.

- **Domain-Specific Expansion:**  
  Dynamically generate subdomains for each domain listed in a given file, ensuring targeted fuzzing.

- **Wordlist Integration:**  
  Supports custom wordlists for words, numbers, and regions to create meaningful subdomains.

- **Batch Processing:**  
  Handles large-scale subdomain generation efficiently with batch-saving functionality.

- **Duplicate Elimination:**  
  Ensures no redundant entries in the generated output.

- **Output Shuffling:**  
  Produces randomized outputs to prevent predictable patterns.

- **High Performance:**  
  Optimized for speed and scalability, capable of handling massive lists effortlessly.

## Use Cases 🔍

- **Bug Bounty Recon:**  
  Expand your scope by discovering hidden subdomains missed by traditional scanners.

- **Security Testing:**  
  Identify potential entry points or misconfigurations in DNS setups.

- **DNS Analysis:**  
  Generate and test DNS permutations for large-scale environments.

- **Data Enrichment:**  
  Create domain variations for intelligence gathering and marketing.

## Installation 🛠️

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Substorm.git
   cd Substorm
   ```

2. Install dependencies (Python 3.7+ required):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   python3 Substorm.py
   ```

## How It Works 📖

1. **Provide a List of Domains:**  
   Input your target domains in the `filtered_subdomains.txt` file. The tool will process each domain from the list.

2. **Custom Wordlists:**  
   Supply wordlists (`word.txt`, `number.txt`, `region.txt`) to the tool for generating subdomains based on patterns.

3. **Define Subdomain Generation Patterns:**  
   Customize the patterns in the configuration file to generate subdomains in various formats (e.g., `{{word}}-{{sub}}.{{domain}}`).

4. **Subdomain Generation:**  
   The tool applies the patterns, generates subdomains for each domain, and saves them in batches for easy access.

5. **Output:**  
   The tool creates organized output files for your subdomain lists, including sanitized, filtered, and batch files.

## Example Outputs 📄

For the input domain: `api.example.com`, Substorm can generate subdomains like:

```
prod-api.example.com
api-prod.example.com
us-east.api.example.com
api123.example.com
test.api.example.com
```

## Configuration 🛠️

You can customize the following settings in the script:

- **Domains File:**  
  `filtered_subdomains.txt` – List of domains you wish to target.

- **Wordlists:**  
  `word.txt`, `number.txt`, `region.txt` – Custom lists to generate subdomains based on words, numbers, and regions.

- **Patterns:**  
  Modify the `patterns` array to use different permutations for subdomain generation.
